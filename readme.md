# TeleCreate
*Procrastination is a bad thing - Me, after not working on features I should be working on and instead making an entirely new project.*

## Why?
Immersive Portals and Create don't play well together. \
"Vanilla" Create is unable to link tracks across Immersive Portals, \
and the rendering of contraptions across portals is buggy. \
This project is an attempt to alleviate some of these concerns.


### I have no idea how to fix the rendering yet, if you've got any pointers please feel free to make a PR/issue.
