# ARCHIVED - I have no time or motivation to maintain this project as of now
I'm sorry for leaving it in a relatively uncertain state, but I'm officially archiving it now until I can find the time to make & maintain an actually *good* solution.

# TeleCreate
*Procrastination is a bad thing - Me, after not working on features I should be working on and instead making an entirely new project.*

## Why?
Immersive Portals and Create don't play well together. \
"Vanilla" Create is unable to link tracks across Immersive Portals, \
and the rendering of contraptions across portals is buggy. \
This project is an attempt to alleviate some of these concerns.

## Addendum
To those that like their mods finely polished and entirely without bugs from the outset, \
I recommend waiting for an official solution, because this was written within as little time as humanly possible, and thus is liable to break.

### I have no idea how to fix the rendering yet, if you've got any pointers please feel free to make a PR/issue.
